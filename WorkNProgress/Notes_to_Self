Starting at Navbar and moving down

What I really need help on: 
  New function in Card List to cover all 3 scenarios

  Help understanding how to pass data from the total form incl. the select dropdown as an obj including properties to dinner array.

  oh - and how to connect the addDinnerForm to the addNewDinner function which is triggered by the Add A Meal button in the Infoheader.


CSS: (Semantic is frustrating)
  Want equal sizes of buttons, select and input on Navbar

**************Functional Problems*******************
  RandomPick Button updates State no longer displays card
  
  Parent Component: 
    line 82: chooseRandom()
    line 191: passed to InfoHeader
    line 190: randomMeal in State, Const and passed to InfoH
  InfoHeader Component:
    line 51,52: both passed to Navbar Line 51,52
    line 116: button using props.chooseRandom

  Problem CardList  needs rewriting.
    skip tertiary
    3 scenarios:  Random Pick, View All and Ethnicity Filter 
------------------------------------------

View All Button  - is connected correctly
  Parent Component:
    line 117: viewAll function
    line 195: passed to InfoHeader
  InfoHeader Component: /Navbar
    line 56: passed to Navbar
    line 129: button using props.viewAll

  Problem is Display  CardList (same for Ethnicity below)
------------------------------------------

Ethnicity Dropdown - 
is connected,Flags are working!!! updates state EthnicType

Const Ethnic Choices [
    {
      key:"mx",
      value:"mx",
      name:"Mexican",
      flag:"mx"
      text: "Mexican"
    }, 
    {
    etc.
    }

] 

currently in InfoHeader eventually should be moved to Parent Component and thereafter to Store

Parent Component:
  line 110 handleEthnicityChange function
  line 139 function passed to InfoHeader
  line 73, 186 ethnicType incl. in state and const
  line 194 passed to InfoHeader
InfoHeader:
  line 133-144 Dropdown Menu 

Problem:
  1. Remember to Clear on Submit (can't find in docs)
  2. right now Select Dropdown sends the data value as the flag "in" this won't match dinners.ethnicity "Indian"
  3. Fix handleEthnicityChange to include
      dinners.filter
      Again - Card List Display


/*handleEthnicityChange = (e, data) => {
    e.preventDefault
    console.log(data.value);
    this.setState({ethnicType:data.value});
  
    then I'd like to do something like this
    if dinners.ethnicity is equal to 
    data.value passed from the Select element then
    map the array and display appropriate cards

    **** problem: Select is returning flag property "mx"
    not value or key which is say "Mexican" which
    would match dinner.ethnicity

     let ethnicChoice = dinners.map(data =>
      if(dinners.ethnicity == props.ethnicType){
      console.log(ethnicChoice);
      }
    }; */

------------------------------------------

Add A Meal Button - 
What does work:
It is connected, adds Obj to dinner Array, # of current choices is updated and an additional blank card is displayed. 

Problem/Goal: 
Add A Meal Button should display addDinnerForm while hiding the dinner cards. Once submitted - form clears, disappears and cards reappear. (one day will use fade in/out)

ParentComponent:
  line 91: function change
  line 131: function addNewDinner
InfoHeader:
  line 148: Button props.addNewDinner
addDinnerForm:
  line 51: Form onSubmit={props.change}  neither work
  line 80: Button onSubmit={props.change

  1. Function Help
      right now only an empty object is added to newArray
      no connection with addDinnerForm

Question:
  Unsure of placement to connect 'things'
  Can't see where to pass onSubmit function in the addDinnerForm 

  Steps taken: 
ParentComponent:
import FormInput from './Form/addDinnerForm';
added to state the fields of the form: rating, meal, ethnicity, description and image - not sure if necessary
line 208: added Form Component and related functions & state items
